# CATBOSS

CATBOSS: Cluster Analysis of Trajectories Based on Segment Splitting

# Pre-requisites:

In order to run CATBOSS, you will need the following dependencies:
1. The SIMPLEchangepoint Python package (https://github.com/DEShawResearch/SIMPLEchangepoint) [1]
2. The MATLAB wrapper for earth mover's distance calculation (https://github.com/garydoranjr/pyemd) [2,3]

Data generated by other research groups needed to reproduce results from the paper are available freely or upon request from these groups:
1. BPTI: https://www.deshawresearch.com/downloads/download_trajectory_science2010.cgi/ (trajectory), https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00604 (benchmark clustering) [4,5]
2. HP35: https://www.deshawresearch.com/downloads/download_trajectory_pnas2012.cgi/ (trajectory), https://github.com/moldyn (dihedral trajectory and clustering) [6,7]

# How to run:
1. Prepare the dataset to be analyzed in space-delimited format, with the first column being time, and the remaining columns being the variables of the dataset. You may also use sample data provided here for your convenience.
2. Run CATBOSS_detectChanges.py <input_file> --lam <lambda value> --alpha <alpha value>
(Optional: Import the change probability matrix and data files into your MATLAB workspace and run CATBOSS_slopeAnalysis.m to identify sloped segments)
3. Import the change probability matrix and data files into your MATLAB workspace and run CATBOSS_distanceMatrix.m
4. Import the distance matrix into your MATLAB workspace and run CATBOSS_cluster.m
5. Import the resulting cluster assignment into your MATLAB workspace and run CATBOSS_mapToPoints.m to get final assignments for each data point.
